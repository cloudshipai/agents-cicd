# Where Claude Hits Limitations (Needs Station + MCP Tools)

## Purpose
This document identifies specific scenarios where Claude cannot provide adequate assistance alone and needs Station agents with MCP tools to deliver real value.

---

## **Scenario 1: Flask App Security Assessment**

### **User Question**: 
*"Is this Flask app production-ready from a security perspective?"*

### **What Claude Can Do**:
✅ Identify basic security issues:
- Hardcoded secrets (`SECRET_KEY = 'super-secret-key-123'`)
- Weak password hashing (`hashlib.md5()`)
- Basic SQL injection patterns
- Missing input validation
- Verbose error messages

### **Where Claude Hits Limitations**:
❌ **Cannot scan dependencies** for known CVEs in `requirements.txt`
❌ **Cannot run static analysis** tools like Bandit, Semgrep, or CodeQL
❌ **Cannot validate compliance** against SOC2, PCI-DSS, or other frameworks
❌ **Cannot check runtime security** - what happens when code actually executes
❌ **Cannot analyze attack surface** - which endpoints are actually exploitable

### **Station Agent + MCP Tools Needed**:

#### **Security Scanner Agent**
```yaml
name: "Flask Security Auditor"
tools:
  - security-scanner-mcp:
      - bandit (Python security linting)
      - semgrep (static analysis)
      - safety (dependency vulnerability scanning)
  - compliance-checker-mcp:
      - OWASP Top 10 validation
      - SOC2 security controls
      - PCI-DSS requirements
  - runtime-security-mcp:
      - Dynamic security testing
      - Penetration testing automation
```

#### **Real Value**:
- **Quantifiable security score**: "Your app has 3 HIGH and 7 MEDIUM vulnerabilities"
- **Compliance status**: "Missing 4 SOC2 controls, here's how to fix them"
- **Actionable remediation**: "Run `pip install bcrypt==4.0.1` and use this code pattern"

## **Scenario 2: Docker Container Production Readiness**

### **User Question**:
*"Should I deploy this container to production?"*

### **What Claude Can Do**:
✅ Review Dockerfile patterns:
- Base image version issues (`FROM python:latest`)
- Layer optimization opportunities
- Running as root user
- Missing health checks
- Development vs production configuration

### **Where Claude Hits Limitations**:
❌ **Cannot scan actual built image** for vulnerabilities
❌ **Cannot analyze final image composition** - what's actually inside?
❌ **Cannot check base image security** - are there known CVEs?
❌ **Cannot validate CIS benchmarks** - does it meet container security standards?
❌ **Cannot measure image performance** - build time, size, startup speed
❌ **Cannot test runtime behavior** - does it actually work when deployed?

### **Station Agent + MCP Tools Needed**:

#### **Container Security Agent**
```yaml
name: "Docker Production Validator"
tools:
  - container-scanner-mcp:
      - trivy (vulnerability scanning)
      - docker-scout (supply chain analysis)
      - grype (container security scanning)
  - image-analyzer-mcp:
      - dive (layer analysis)
      - docker-slim (optimization analysis)
  - benchmark-validator-mcp:
      - CIS Docker Benchmark
      - NIST container security guidelines
  - runtime-tester-mcp:
      - container startup tests
      - health check validation
```

#### **Real Value**:
- **Security report**: "Container has 12 HIGH vulnerabilities in base image"
- **Optimization guidance**: "Image could be 60% smaller by removing these layers"
- **Production readiness**: "❌ Fails 8 CIS benchmark controls - here's the fixes"

---

## **Scenario 3: Application Performance Analysis**

### **User Question**:
*"Will this Flask app handle 1000 concurrent users?"*

### **What Claude Can Do**:
✅ Identify potential bottlenecks:
- Database connection per request (no pooling)
- Synchronous blocking operations
- Missing caching strategies
- No rate limiting
- Inefficient query patterns

### **Where Claude Hits Limitations**:
❌ **Cannot measure actual performance** - response times, throughput
❌ **Cannot profile under load** - where does it break?
❌ **Cannot analyze resource usage** - CPU, memory, disk I/O patterns
❌ **Cannot identify real bottlenecks** - is it database, CPU, or network?
❌ **Cannot predict scaling behavior** - what happens at 100, 500, 1000 users?
❌ **Cannot compare alternatives** - SQLite vs PostgreSQL performance impact

### **Station Agent + MCP Tools Needed**:

#### **Performance Analysis Agent**
```yaml
name: "Flask Performance Auditor"  
tools:
  - load-tester-mcp:
      - locust (load testing)
      - artillery (API performance testing)
      - wrk (HTTP benchmarking)
  - profiler-mcp:
      - py-spy (Python profiling)
      - flask-profiler (application profiling)
  - resource-monitor-mcp:
      - psutil (system resource monitoring)
      - prometheus metrics collection
  - database-analyzer-mcp:
      - SQLite performance analysis
      - Query optimization recommendations
```

#### **Real Value**:
- **Performance baseline**: "Current setup handles 47 concurrent users before degrading"
- **Bottleneck identification**: "Database connection overhead causes 80% of latency"
- **Scaling recommendations**: "Add connection pooling → supports 300 users. Switch to PostgreSQL → supports 1000+"

## **Scenario 4: Kubernetes Deployment Strategy**

### **User Question** (Coming in Step 3):
*"How should I deploy this Flask app to Kubernetes in production?"*

### **What Claude Can Do**:
✅ Write basic Kubernetes manifests
✅ Suggest deployment patterns (rolling updates, blue/green)
✅ Recommend resource limits and requests
✅ Basic security context suggestions

### **Where Claude Hits Limitations**:
❌ **Cannot validate cluster capacity** - will it actually fit?
❌ **Cannot analyze network policies** - is the security model correct?
❌ **Cannot test deployment scenarios** - what happens during rollouts?
❌ **Cannot optimize resource allocation** - right-size requests/limits
❌ **Cannot validate against K8s security benchmarks** - CIS Kubernetes controls

### **Station Agent + MCP Tools Needed**:
```yaml
name: "Kubernetes Deployment Advisor"
tools:
  - k8s-validator-mcp:
      - kubectl dry-run validation
      - kube-score security scoring
      - polaris best practices
  - cluster-analyzer-mcp:
      - cluster capacity analysis  
      - resource optimization
  - security-policy-mcp:
      - network policy validation
      - RBAC analysis
      - pod security standards
```

## **Pattern Recognition**

### **Common Limitations**:
1. **Cannot execute tools** - I can suggest them but can't run them
2. **Cannot measure real-world impact** - performance, security, resource usage
3. **Cannot validate against standards** - compliance frameworks, benchmarks
4. **Cannot provide quantifiable results** - scores, metrics, concrete measurements

### **Where Station + MCP Adds Value**:
1. **Executable analysis** - actually run security scans, performance tests, validations
2. **Quantifiable results** - "3 HIGH vulnerabilities" vs "has security issues"
3. **Context-aware recommendations** - based on actual measurements, not general advice
4. **Automated validation** - continuous checks against standards and benchmarks

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Pick one scenario** to implement first (recommend Scenario 1 - Security)
2. **Build the MCP tool integration** for that specific use case  
3. **Create the Station agent** that uses those tools
4. **Test against our Flask app** to prove the value
5. **Document the improvement** in decision-making capability
6. **Repeat for other scenarios**

**Goal**: Demonstrate that Station agents + MCP tools provide capabilities that Claude alone simply cannot offer.
